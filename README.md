# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project is a Heart Disease Prediction System built using a KNN machine learning model. It takes basic health inputs from the user and predicts the chance of having heart disease. The model is trained on a real medical dataset and includes scaling and preprocessing steps for accurate results. The Streamlit app makes it easy to use and understand, even for beginners. All required model files such as scaler and column mapping are included. You can run the project locally or deploy it online using Streamlit Cloud. This project is useful for learning ML deployment and end-to-end model workflow.
